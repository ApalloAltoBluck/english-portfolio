Number (N)ine was met with universal acclaim and developed a cult following. To the shock of fashion connoisseurs globally, Miyashita announced his departure from Number (N)ine in 2009, and ostensibly disappeared from the fashion scene.

This collection, as well as future collections, are an excellent introduction for those wanting to find a starting point in the Japanese designer’s fashion legacy. Miyashita’s debut brand, Number (N)ine, still makes clothing under the Number (N)ine label, however, Miyashita’s departure from the company in 2009 has left the company lacking originality.
