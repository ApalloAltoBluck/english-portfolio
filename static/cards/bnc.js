    description: "Gone are the days of ‘rip & read’ of unbiased mainstream news reporting.  Today, news is interpreted, rewritten and “spun” to the prevailing taste of a specific audience.  So, in partnership with Carol H Williams Advertising, Buckstarter created the new logo for the first-ever 24-hour cable news platform dedicated to black news, the Black News Channel.  Inspired by the positive impacts Black culture has had on mainstream culture, the “Illuminating Suns” imagery drives home our guiding principle that mainstream news should not treat the news of the AA community as invisible. Rather it should shine a light on a positive new day forward.    ",
