    description: "Imagine a world where all the cheese or all the wine tasted exactly the same. One standard variety of cheese or wine? How boring. But for the last 30-years, that's exactly what the US has settled for with the standardized milk found in most yogurts. Better-quality milk makes for better yogurt. Buckstarter found this simple and elegant product truth and created a whole new kind of yogurt -Better Milk Yogurt. We developed the complete brand design, logo, packaging, website and social media campaign for Nat√ºrlich Better Milk Yogurt. Made with richer Jersey Cow milk that is non-homogenized, GMO Project verified and A2 certified. A new standard of quality & creaminess. ",
