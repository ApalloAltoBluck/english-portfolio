    description: "Amy D’Agostino is a powerhouse in corporate compliance law, and a litany of other legal services. But what sets Amy apart from the other Big Law firms is her entrepreneurial spirit. She is the furthest thing from a slow, stodgy, dense, write-haired law firm. Buckstarter set out to properly define Amy E. D’Agostino as the powerhouse brand that she is. We developed the New Kind of Lawyer, A New Kind of Firm brand manifesto, website, and the SEO, Display and LinkedIn campaign for this new kind of law firm that is anything but ordinary.",
